# Context

A digital template serves as a framework that can be tailored or populated with specific information to generate the physical twin. It encompasses the software operating the physical twin, its digital model, and all the essential information needed for constructing and sustaining the physical twin, such as blueprints, bills of materials, technical manuals, and similar documentation [2].

The following components can be identified for the **digital template**:

# Definition

A **digital template** serves as a framework that can be tailored or populated with specific information to generate the physical twin. It encompasses the software operating the physical twin, its digital model,
and all the essential information needed for constructing and sustaining the physical twin, such as blueprints, bills of materials, technical manuals, and similar documentation.

## Key Points:
- Combines the physical twinâ€™s software, digital models, blueprints, and documentation.
- Provides the structure and data needed to recreate or understand the physical twin.
- In the case of the PiCar-X, the **digital template** includes software, a CAD model, and documentation on materials and schematics.

# The Digital Template of the PiCar-X
The following components can be identified for the digital template:

- [the embedded control software from the PiCar-X](https://github.com/cau-se/ARCHES-PiCar-X/tree/main/PiCar-X)
- the digital model
- [the documentation including the list of materials, the robot HAT blue prints, etc.]({https://docs.sunfounder.com/projects/picar-x/en/latest/index.html)
- [the Raspberry Pi documentation, including mechanical drawings and schematics.](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/raspberry-pi.html)

The current configuration lacks the blueprints for key hardware components such as servo and DC motors. Ideally, a complete digital template would encompass all necessary assets to replicate the \pt from scratch. However, this scenario is often impractical, as most machines are composed of various components, and it is rare for a single company to manufacture every part [2].
