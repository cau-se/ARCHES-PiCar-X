# The Digital Twin Concept and its Sub-Concepts
The ARCHES PiCar-X was specifically developed to help scientists and engineers understand and experiment with the concept of Digital Twins. In our paper "[From Digital Twins to Digital Twin Prototypes: Concepts, Formalization, and Applications](https://doi.org/10.1109/access.2024.3406510)", we formalized the Digital Twin concept and its sub-concepts physical twin, digital model, digital template, digital thread, digital shadow, digital twin, and digital twin prototype using Object-Z. In "[Toward Reproducibility of Digital Twin Research: Exemplified with the PiCar-X.](https://doi.org/10.48550/ARXIV.2408.13866)", we then demonstrated how these concepts were implemented using the ARCHES PiCar-X. This project contains the source code for that implementation.
